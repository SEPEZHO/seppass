Telegram bot is intended to store users passwords and other notes. I created this bot just because it was interesting for me. After seppass was brought to mind, i stopped work on it. And this project was too big for solo development. Every user after log in get his individually gpg-key. Only user know password from it. Its means that even with data leaks, nobody can`t decrypt those. Also seppass can automatically synchronize all encrypted passwords with user git-system. I created site with discriprion for him.
